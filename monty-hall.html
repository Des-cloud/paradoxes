      <h1>The Monty Hall Problem</h1>
    <main>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <article class="intro">
          If you are familiar with the TV show, Let's Make A Deal, you will probably have heard of the name Monty Hall.
        He served as the original host of the show. The show led to the widespread study of this in the field of 
        Probability and Statistics and thus got the problem named after him. The interesting thing about this problem is 
        the difficulty people have with agreeing to the solution. Let's get right into it!

      <article class="intro">
        Imagine you are among three people of which one person will be selected as the winner of a prestigious award. 
        You keep bugging the head of the committee wanting to know if you won. He gets tired and agrees to give you clue. 
        He says he cannot say anything about your chances but mentions the name of one of your competitors who lost. 
        You immediately start celebrating because you chances have increased from 1 in 3 to 1 in 2. But errmm...<br>
        Has your chances really increased?ü§î This is a variation of the problem under discussion.

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <article class="problem">
      The Monty Hall Problem is stated simply as: <br>
        Suppose you‚Äôre on a game show, and you‚Äôre given the choice of three doors: 
        Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You are asked to choose one door without opening it.
        You pick a door, say No. 1. The host, who knows what‚Äôs 
        behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, 
        ‚ÄúYou are free to choose door 2 if you wish.‚Äù The problem is, should you switch or not?

      <h3> Switch!! </h3>
      <article class="solution"> 
        Believe it or not, it‚Äôs actually to your benefit to switch:
        If you switch, you have roughly a 2/3 chance of winning the car.
        If you stick to your original choice you have roughly a 1/3 chance of winning the car.
        The answer sounds unlikely and people have a hard time understanding and thus accepting it.
        After door 3 is opened, you would think that you then have two doors to 
        choose from‚Ä¶both with the same odds. Therefore, your odds are now 50-50. 
        However, you are actually much more likely to win if you switch. When the host of the show opens the wrong door, the odds
        of the other door "picks up" that of the open door making switching 2/3 chances to win. The probability of your first choice,
        does not change. If you are still confused, don't worry. Even some mathematicians find it hard to come to terms with it.
        The best way for you to come to terms with it is to actually play the 
        <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~crypto/Monty/monty.html" target="blank">simulation.</a>
        This fact has been proved over and over again with a plethora of mathematical simulations.
