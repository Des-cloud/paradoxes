      <h1>The Chinese Postman Problem</h1>
    <main>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <article class="intro">
          Have you ever imagined if you could travel along a route starting at an intersection or point and returning to
          the same intersection by traversing each street, lane or road of the route exactly
          once? What about drawing a diagram in a continuous motion through a set of points
          without lifting a pencil so that no part of the picture is retraced? Try doing it on the diagram below.

      <article class="intro">
        Imagine you saw a store selling something you are interested while you were in a car.
        Now you get home and days later you are interested in purchasing this thing, but
        you do not remember the actual street and store. With no luck in internet searching
        or with asking neighbours your only choice is to go street by street looking for this
        store. In order not to waste your time and energy, you will like to take the shortest
        length through all the streets. Therefore, you will like to avoid traversing the same
        street over and over as this will waste your time. Also, you might even lose track
        of the streets you have traversed already. Ideally, you would like to traverse each
        street once and if not possible, traverse each route the least number of times. This
        problem is similar to an old problem that has been bothering lots of people. It is very similar
        to the question asked by the people of Konigsberg(<a href="#news">Konigsberg Bridge Problem</a>) but with a little modification to
        the conditions. These problem and similar ones have been termed generally as the
        Chinese Postman Problem after the great Chinese mathematician, Meigu Guan.

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <article class="problem">
      The Chinese Postman problem is a closely related problem. Chinese mathematician
      Meigu Guan, who had been a postman himself, posed this problem in 1962. Guan stated the problem simply as: 
      "A mailman has to cover his assigned segment before
      returning to the post office. The problem is to find the shortest walking distance for
      the mailman." To make it clear, the mailman has to deliver a mail to at least one
      box on every street in his or her assigned segment. In contrast to the <a href="#news">Konigsberg Bridge Problem</a>, 
      the Chinese postman problem asks for the shortest walk length passing
      each street, lane or road at least once. Therefore, although the postman can use a
      road multiple times, the shortest walking length always seeks to reduce the number
      of times he traverses a specific road. From figure below, if a postman starts at A, he
      is supposed to traverse all the streets, represented as edges, at least once and return back to his starting
      point. The problem the Chinese postman seeks to answer is "what is the shortest
      walking path the postman can take following the conditions above". In situations
      like the one in figure below, it is easy to carve such a path, but it gets difficult when we
      place the postman in large urban areas and even cities.

      <h3> Real World Applications/Situations</h3>
      <article class="applications"> 
        This problem and its solutions have become very popular due to its varied applications
        in a number of practical situations aside mail delivery. The problem exists or can exist
        in almost all delivery and distribution managements industries. Examples of such fields are:
        <ul>
          <li>Garbage collection</li>
          <li>School bus routing</li>
          <li>Police patrolling</li>
          <li>Snow removal</li>
          <li>Road gritting</li>
          <li>Street cleaning operations</li>
        </ul>
        For instance,
        a company like Amazon which makes a lot of deliveries in a particular area would
        rather a driver find the shortest possible drive length to reduce time spent and fuel
        consumption. With the need for efficiency, companies and governments have been
        researching this problem in hopes of finding better solutions to reduce wastage of
        resources.
