      <h1>The Rich Guest Paradox</h1>
    <main>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <article class="intro">
          This is one of the most interesting paradoxes I have come across. Read it for yourself and also wonder!
      </article>
      
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <article class="problem">
      There is a very poor, quaint, little town where everyone is in a huge debt with someone but has no money to pay it back.<br>
        <br>There is a hotel which is hardly seeing any business anymore. They are to soon shut it down. One day a very wealthy
        American guest shows up and wants to spend a night there. However, before he confirms, he asks for a tour of the hotel.
        The receptionist asks for a security deposit which the American can take back in case he doesn‚Äôt like the rooms.
        The guest obliges. It turns out by a matter of luck this is the exact amount that the hotel owed to the chef as salary
        for three months which they hadn‚Äôt been able to pay. They gave the cash to the chef.<br><br>
        The chef saw that this was the exact amount of cash he owed the grocer for months of groceries he hadn‚Äôt been able to pay 
        for. He paid the grocer. The grocer realized it was the exact amount he owed the doctor for treating his wife‚Äôs 
        arthritis, so he paid the doctor. Then the doctor paid the money to the nurse for two months of service he couldn‚Äôt 
        pay for. The nurse was new to the town, so she had been staying in the hotel for a few days before she found a house 
        to rent. She too was poor and couldn‚Äôt pay the hotel at that time. The money she received from the doctor was exactly 
        what she owed the hotel, so she paid.<br><br>
        Now the hotel had got back the exact amount it had paid the chef. Then the guest has finished his tour of the rooms, 
        and it turns out he doesn‚Äôt like it. He takes back his security deposit from the hotel and leaves, never to be seen again. 
        So everyone‚Äôs debt has been paid, but nothing is different from before. No one has earned anything. But now everyone is 
        happy even though the money has done nothing but to return to its first owner. Therefore, this paradox is basically 
        describing how nothing had changed from the start, but along the way, debts were paid, with no money.<br><br>
        <span class="question">Did the debt really exist at all? How exactly did this work?</span>
      </article>
      
      <h3>How!! </h3>
      <article class="applications"> 
        Although this paradox seems strange at the first read, it isn't at all. Although all the debtors have paid their debts 
        off and are happy (especially the hotel manager), they also all lost some amount of money that was owed them. So if 
        $100 was the initial deposit, then all the people who was involved in the transfer of the money, gained and lost $100 each, 
        thus cancelling the effect. In short, none of them got less poorer (bummer üòê).
